# LinkedIn-Job-Posting-Analysis

I took a part in Power Bi Portfolio Project Competition 2.0 which was hosted by Techtip24. 

## Project Overview 

I conducted a comprehensive analysis on LinkedIn Jobs that are Posted. I look into job market trends, focusing on application patterns, peak posting times, popular job titles, company dynamics, geographical insights, sector-specific details, job freshness, and company behaviors. In essence, my analysis offers valuable insights for both job seekers and employers.
